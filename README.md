# Citadel: A Storyline Graphing Tool
The aim of this project is to develop an intuitive interface for Graphviz, store user notes regarding narrative works, and enable repeated and comfortable use of the tool to an average user. Produced by Ryan Mahoney. 

## Method
“Taking notes aids your comprehension and retention. Researchers found that if important information was contained in notes, it had a 34% chance of being remembered (Howe, 1970, in Longman and Atkinson, 1999). Information not found in notes had only a 5% chance of being remembered.”
